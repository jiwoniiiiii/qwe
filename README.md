# YOLO-V5
Report Of Learning AI Using YOLO V5

# SUBJECT OF LEARNING
There are many features to find a lost phone, but it is hard to locate lost AirPods. So, I thought it would be great to develop an AI that can recognize AirPods and help find them when captured by a camera.

# VIDEO FOR LEARNING
I trained the AI by recording videos of the AirPods unit.
# VIDEO LABELING
I labeled the AirPods unit by specifying it.
